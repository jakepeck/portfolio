      <h2>Driven by curiosity.</h2>
        <p>
          I am a full-stack developer based in Chicago. Highly motivated by
          creating solutions to challenging problems, programming has always been one of my
          greatest passions. 
        </p>
      <h2>Optimization Oriented.</h2>
      <p>Whether it has been in an educational, workplace, or sports environment, I always give everything I attack in life 100%, 
        and look for any possible way to improve, even if it means make the tiniest change elsewhere. 
        I have always, and will always hold myself to a high standard. The pursuit of excellence is one of the values that resonates strongest with me.</p>
      <h2>A Formidable Leader, But An Even More Formidable Teammate.</h2>
      <p>While my leadership abilities have allowed me to flourish in roles managing teams, I believe that I add even more value as a teammate.
       I'm personable, confident, and supportive of the team's goals and mission. </p>
